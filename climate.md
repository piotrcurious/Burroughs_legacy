Short answer up front: Burroughs never wrote a neat academic “theory of willpower.” He wrote novels, essays and techniques that revolve around control, habit, language-as-virus, and methods for disrupting those patterns (cut-ups, routine-breaking). If you read those moves as a theory of “will,” it’s a paradoxical one: will is both the tool of control (the mechanism that keeps us trapped in routines and systems) and the means to break control when it’s deployed as deliberate, disruptive technique. Taking that paradox and placing it beside global warming, Jungian collective unconscious ideas, and chaos-magic practice yields a surprisingly fertile — and politically sharp — set of insights and interventions. Below I sketch that synthesis and its practical, ethical consequences.

1) Burroughs’ attitude toward “will” (essentials)

Anti-teleology: Burroughs distrusted linear narratives of progress and the idea that a single coherent ego/will is the sovereign center of action. In his fiction and essays he treats the self as a node in control systems (habits, language, institutions).

Will as control system: “Will” often operates as the mechanism that reproduces addiction, routine and social control. Addiction (substance, habit, ideology) is a key metaphor: the addict’s “will” is co-opted by compulsive circuits.

Will as technique: At the same time, Burroughs offered techniques (cut-ups, deliberate speech acts, ritualized habits) that function like “counter-will” — intentional disruptions designed to fragment the control system and open space for new patterns.

Language and memetics: Burroughs repeatedly claims language is viral — it programs minds. Controlling language equals controlling will; disrupting language can liberate will.


2) Read Burroughs onto global warming

If you treat the climate crisis through Burroughs’ lens, several themes stand out:

Habit and industrial addiction. Fossil-fuel dependence reads as mass addiction: economic, cultural and technological routines that reproduce themselves independent of short-term human intentions. The “will” that could stop emissions is largely embedded in institutions, markets and reflexive consumer behaviors — not simply a matter of personal resolve.

Language-shaping reality. Climate narratives, marketing, and denialist rhetoric are memetic viruses. They shape what people feel is possible and therefore what collective will can emerge. Changing language — the metaphors, stories and framings — changes collective possibilities.

Control systems and feedback loops. Burroughs loved systems metaphors. The greenhouse economy is a set of feedback loops (policy, lobbying, energy infrastructure) that stabilize a destructive path. Breaking them requires interventions that are structural, not merely individual.

Two kinds of “will” needed. The “will” that created the system (short-term profit, technological mastery) is different from the disruptive, creative will Burroughs advocates — a will that fragments dominant narratives and reconfigures practice.


3) Collective unconscious (Jung) — where Burroughs and Jung can speak to each other

Archetypes as memetic hardware. Jung’s collective unconscious supplies recurring images and emotional templates that make certain narratives sticky (e.g., the Promethean “man conquering nature” archetype). Burroughs’ language-virus idea maps onto this: archetypal motifs are powerful memetic attractors that condition collective behavior.

Dream/imaginal terrain. Burroughs’ cut-ups and dream-record techniques attempt to access and remix the preconscious — that neighborhood where archetypes live. For climate action, reshaping imaginal content (symbols, art, icons) can rewire what people feel is desirable or possible.

Shadow and projection. The climate crisis invites projection: industrial harms are dissociated into “others” or future generations. Burroughs’ work constantly forces projection back onto the self — an ethical move that aligns with Jung’s work on integrating the shadow.


4) Chaos magic — why Burroughs’ methods are congenial to it

Pragmatic belief. Chaos magicians treat belief as a tool: adopt, use, discard. Burroughs’ experimental adoption of beliefs, rituals and cut-ups as practical devices echoes this.

Sigil-like cut-ups. A cut-up can function like a sigil: a textual operation intended to effect change by altering attention and symbolic structure. Recutting dominant climate narratives is an act of memetic sigilization.

Will vs. gnosis. Chaos magic distinguishes between focused intent (will) and ecstatic states (gnosis). Burroughs’ techniques often combine deliberate attention with altered states to short-circuit habitual cognition — a similar tactical pairing.


5) Practical, Burroughs-style interventions for climate culture

(These are programmatic, not prescriptive; Burroughs would likely approve mischievous, decentralized tactics.)

Memetic cut-ups. Consciously remix messaging: break dominant ad-language that normalizes extraction. Micro-interventions — cut-up ads, mash-ups that expose contradiction — can shift what media primes.

Ritualized habit-breaking. Introduce small collective rituals that interrupt consumption loops (e.g., public “shutdown” ceremonies for a product line, or neighborhood ritual fasts from certain energy uses). Ritual lowers the threshold for communal change.

Narrative sabotage. Use art and fiction to fragment the Promethean archetype (the “conquer nature” story). Replace it with new, distributed archetypes: mutuality, repair, reciprocation.

Strategic ambiguity and belief-experiments. Borrowing chaos magic, run short belief experiments: temporarily amplify a new frame (“we are a rewilding culture”) in a community or campaign to test downstream behaviors. If it produces measurable shifts, scale it; if not, discard.

Structural will: combine memetic tactics with technical policy leverage. Burroughsian disruption is not an alternative to policy — it’s a complement. Disruptive art primes public will; policy converts will into system change (regulation, infrastructure).

Decode and expose control language. Make visible the marketing/financial language that rationalizes extraction — show how it works as a control system.


6) Ethical and political caveats (Burroughs’ own ambivalence helps here)

Will can be coercive. Burroughs understood control ambivalently — techniques that liberate for some can be used to dominate others. Any “will” deployed at scale can become authoritarian. Be explicit about consent and power distribution.

Don’t fetishize the individual will. Burroughs’ critique of the sovereign ego suggests that focusing only on individual “resolve” is inadequate. Systemic change and distributed collective practice matter far more.

Beware of magical thinking as escape. Chaos-magic tactics can energize movements, but they must be tethered to material policy and engineering realities (energy systems, finance, supply chains).


7) A compact synthesis — how these strands meet

Diagnose: climate crisis is a control-system problem sustained by habitual, memetic and infrastructural will.

Therapeutics (Burroughsian): introduce interventions that fragment control (cut-ups, symbolic disruption, ritualized habit-breaking) to reconfigure the imaginal and behavioral terrain.

Practice (chaos magic + Jung): use pragmatic belief experiments and symbolic work to alter the collective unconscious’s attractors; pair those with material policy and infrastructure change so imagination becomes practice.

Guardrails: monitor for coercion, center justice, and prioritize structural change over theatrical gestures alone.


8) One concrete micro-example you can imagine

Run a localized campaign combining art, ritual and policy pressure: produce a series of cut-up audio/video pieces that splice corporate greenwashing with community testimony; stage a neighborhood “unbranding” ritual where billboards are collectively retexted; use the attention to push a concrete policy demand (e.g., municipal divestment from fossil fuels). The cut-ups reconfigure imaginal space, the ritual creates communal habit change, and the policy demand converts cultural will into institutional action.

If you want, I can:

sketch a short “cut-up” script (textual/sound) you could use as an eco-sigil, or

draft a micro-campaign that pairs Burroughs-style memetic disruptions with specific municipal policy asks.


Which would you prefer?
