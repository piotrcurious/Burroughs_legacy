To explain William S. Burroughs' theory of willpower in this context, we must first understand that for Burroughs, willpower is a weapon. It is not merely self-discipline; it is a counter-insurgency tactic used to hack a reality that has been pre-programmed by hostile control systems.
In the Burroughsian universe, we are living in a "Reality Studio" run by a virus. Below is an explanation of how his concept of Willpower interacts with Global Warming, the Collective Unconscious, and Chaos Magic.
1. The Core Thesis: The War Universe
Burroughs famously stated, "This is a war universe. War all the time."
For Burroughs, "Will" is the only thing that distinguishes a living being from an automaton. Most human beings have surrendered their will to external forces (media, government, biology, language).
 * The Theory: Willpower is the act of "waking up" from the script. It is the refusal to be a host for the parasite.
2. Context: Global Warming (The Parasite killing the Host)
If Burroughs were alive to address global warming directly, he would likely frame it not as a "mistake" or "accident" of industry, but as the inevitable terminal stage of a viral infection.
 * The "Human Virus": Burroughs explicitly viewed the human species (or specifically, the Word Virus inhabiting humans) as a parasite. A successful parasite keeps its host alive; a stupid or malignant one kills it.
 * Global Warming as "The Nova": In his Nova Trilogy, the "Nova Mob" (cosmic gangsters) infiltrate a planet, incite conflict, and suck all the resources dry until the planet explodes (goes "Nova"). Global warming is the heat of the host body fighting the infection, or perhaps the "Nova ovens" turning on.
 * Willpower's Role: In this context, "Green" activism is insufficient if it relies on the same "Control Systems" (politics/media) that caused the problem. True Willpower requires a radical decoupling from the system of consumption—literally "cutting the lines" of the parasite that feeds on the planet.
3. Context: The Collective Unconscious (The Word Virus)
Burroughs rejects the Jungian "Collective Unconscious" as a benevolent spiritual library. Instead, he views it as a hostile data bank.
 * Language as a Virus: Burroughs believed that "Language is a virus from outer space." What we call the "collective unconscious" is actually a foreign invasion—a viral program that infected early hominids, rewiring our brains to think in words.
 * The Shared Hallucination: This virus creates a "film" over reality, forcing us all to see the same things, value the same money, and fear the same authorities. We don't share an "unconscious"; we share an infection.
 * Willpower's Role: Willpower is the ability to shut up. It is the ability to achieve internal silence. By stopping the internal monologue (the Word Virus), you disconnect from the collective unconscious and see reality as it truly is—which is the first step to manipulating it.
4. Context: Chaos Magic (The Toolkit of Will)
Burroughs is often cited as a grandfather of Chaos Magic. His approach was practical, result-oriented, and devoid of mysticism. Magic was simply "causing change in conformity with will" by hacking the reality studio.
 * The Cut-Up Method: By physically cutting up texts and rearranging them, you break the "control lines" of the Word Virus. You introduce randomness into the rigid script of reality, allowing the future to leak out.
 * Playback & The Recorder: Burroughs believed tape recorders were magical weapons. By recording the sounds of a target (e.g., a government office) and playing them back with "trouble noises" (gunshots, screams) at the location, you could manifest disaster on that location.
 * Willpower's Role: In Chaos Magic, belief is a tool, not a truth. Willpower is the force that allows you to adopt a belief system (paradigm) to get a result, and then discard it. It is the "directed attention" that collapses the wave function of reality.
Summary: The Unified Theory
Putting it all together, the Burroughsian Theory of Willpower is:
> Global Warming is the physical manifestation of the Collective Unconscious (Word Virus) eating its host (Earth). The only way to stop it is not through "policy," but through Chaos Magic (Willpower)—specifically, the use of Will to break the linguistic and social programming that forces us to consume and destroy. We must "storm the Reality Studio" and retake the universe from the Nova Mob.

Instructional Next Step
To apply this practically (and safely), one could start with the simplest Burroughsian technique for reclaiming Willpower.
Would you like me to explain the "Do Easy" technique (DE), which Burroughs described as a method for retraining the nervous system to regain agency in a chaotic world?
