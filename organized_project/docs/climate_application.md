# Applying the Burroughs Machine to Climate Change

William S. Burroughs' theories of language, control, and deconstruction provide a powerful and unconventional lens through which to view the climate crisis. This document synthesizes various perspectives on how the "Burroughs Machine"—a conceptual framework for deconstructing and re-engineering reality through language—can be applied to the discourse surrounding climate change.

## Climate Change as a Control System

From a Burroughsian perspective, the climate crisis is not simply an environmental problem; it is a crisis of control. The global industrial economy, fueled by fossil fuels, is a vast and self-perpetuating "control system" that operates on a logic of its own, independent of human intentions. This system is maintained by a number of interlocking mechanisms:

*   **Habit and Industrial Addiction:** Our dependence on fossil fuels is a form of mass addiction, with economic, cultural, and technological routines that reproduce themselves automatically.
*   **Language and Memetics:** Climate narratives, marketing, and denialist rhetoric are "memetic viruses" that shape our perception of reality and limit our sense of what is possible.
*   **Feedback Loops:** The greenhouse economy is a set of feedback loops that stabilize a destructive path. These include political lobbying, energy infrastructure, and consumer behavior.

## Willpower as a Counter-Insurgency Tactic

In the face of such a powerful control system, "willpower" is not simply a matter of individual resolve; it is a counter-insurgency tactic. It is the act of "waking up" from the script, of refusing to be a host for the "parasite" of consumerism and industrialism. This kind of willpower requires a radical decoupling from the system of consumption, a "cutting of the lines" that bind us to the control machine.

## The Burroughs Machine as a Weapon

The Burroughs Machine is a weapon in this fight. It is a tool for hacking the "reality studio" of climate change discourse, for breaking down the "control texts" of the fossil fuel industry and the political establishment, and for creating new, alternative realities. This can be done through a variety of techniques:

*   **Memetic Cut-Ups:** Consciously remixing and mashing up corporate greenwashing and political doublespeak to expose its contradictions and absurdities.
*   **Narrative Sabotage:** Using art and fiction to fragment the dominant narratives of progress and technological mastery, and to replace them with new archetypes of mutuality, repair, and reciprocation.
*   **Ritualized Habit-Breaking:** Introducing small, collective rituals that interrupt the loops of consumption and create new patterns of behavior.

## Chaos Magic and the Collective Unconscious

The Burroughsian approach to climate change also draws on the ideas of chaos magic and the Jungian collective unconscious. From this perspective, the "control system" of climate change is not just an external, material reality; it is also an internal, psychological one. The "archetypes" of the collective unconscious—the Promethean myth of man conquering nature, for example—are the "memetic hardware" on which the "software" of climate denial and inaction runs.

The Burroughs Machine can be used to hack this hardware, to create new "sigils" and "memes" that can reprogram the collective unconscious and open up new possibilities for collective action.

## The Cybernetic Re-Evaluation

A more advanced application of the Burroughs Machine to climate change involves a "cybernetic re-evaluation" of the problem. From this perspective, the climate crisis is not "chaos," but a rigid and stable "cybernetic loop." The solution, therefore, is not to smash the machine, but to reprogram it. This can be done by:

*   **Identifying "Control Points":** Using network theory to identify the "load-bearing" pillars of the climate change narrative—words like "growth," "security," and "necessity."
*   **Cryptoanalytic Shifting:** Re-weighting the "edges" of the network to lower the probability of the "control paths" and to amplify the probability of "latent paths"—the suppressed connections between ideas like "nature" and "sacredness," or "silence" and "satisfaction."

## Conclusion: The Electronic Revolution

The application of the Burroughs Machine to climate change is not a substitute for political action or technological innovation. It is a complementary strategy, a way of using the power of language and art to reconfigure the "imaginal and behavioral terrain" of the climate crisis. It is a way of "storming the reality studio" and taking back control of our collective future. It is the "electronic revolution" that Burroughs envisioned, a revolution of consciousness that is the necessary precondition for any meaningful change in the material world.
